synopsis:            DSL to generate HTML5 Canvas javascript.
description:
  A simple DSL for writing HTML5 Canvas in haskell and converting it
  to Javascript. By static we mean non-interactive, so the parts of
  the Canvas API that need to query the browser for run time information
  like `isPointInPath(x, y)` are not included. This turns out to be
  a surprisingly small part of HTML5 Canvas.
